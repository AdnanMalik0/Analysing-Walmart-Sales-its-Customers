# Analysing-Walmart-Sales-its-Customers

Walmart Product sales and Customer data were taken and a Tableau Dashboard was prepared. The Dashboard helps in understanding Walmart's Sales from the year 2012 to 2016. The Dashboard also shows how different Customer Segments behave in their Purchases, giving a good idea about how each Customer Segment can be targeted.

Refer to Dashboard.png file for a quick look at the Dashboard.
